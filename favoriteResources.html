        An amazing resource with FREE education as its mission. Sal Khan
        provides everything you need to brush up / start on your math journey.
        There is also a computer programming section which I used to get started
        on this journey.

        This extensive guide dives deep into the subject of computer science and
        what it takes for one to take the challenge on themselves. It
        illustrates a long but clear path into the field. I have'nt quite caught
        up with even the beginning of this guide but it will be go to throughout
        my learning journey.

        Another great guide for the even more beginner friendly (me) needs. This
        comes with a few videos, resources, book lists, and a community (most
        important) that will help me get started on the way. Its great to ask
        yourself 'Why do I want to program?' when getting started. Set goals
        early and started working on projects.

        So this is a PAID resource. It is about $35 per month. I decided to go
        with this particular programming because I really enjoy the way he
        speaks, articulates, and he obviously has a very commanding
        understanding of the knowledge necessary to program. I spend many hours
        on youtube and using FREE resources before I decided to go with a paid
        instructor. To be clear I probably spent around 200 hours of learning
        before I decided to get this subscription. If you are thinking about the
        same route I suggest you exhaust as many free resources as possible
        until you feel the need to pay someone. It is really nice (to me) to
        have well laid out structures and progress indicators. It helps small
        goals and feel like I have been making progress.
