    <h1>Learning to code</h1>
    <h2>How quitting alcholol has effected my pursuit of computer programming</h2>
    <p>
      It has been 30 days since I have had a drink of alcohol. I choose to mark this day with the energy it takes
      to write this post. I am writing this in a coding editor. A new project I have taken on since quitting the drink.
      Quitting has not been hard. My brain sometimes tries to make it that way. I have days that I don't feel so good
      because thats what sobriety means. Feelings things as they come. I admit, I am not 'fully' sober. I still smoke 
      weed everyday. I smoked it before I wrote this post, before I started my day. I am ok with that for now. Soon this
      fog will one day leave me as well. I seek mental clarity and the ability to ACT. I seek mental memory so that I might
      build integrity. In my personal experience with frequent drinking it has been all to easy to abandon everything in pursuit
      of a relaxing spirit. To relax my spirit. I believe drugs are the enemy of art, as I heard a famous actor say. They are moon
      regulators. Well, I dont want my mood regulated anymore. I want my mood to be felt and expressed. I know thats what I want for me
      and thats what I want for everyone. I don't think alcholol effects everyone the same. I just know my experience with it. Love it as 
      I do. As much as I love it. This is my relationship with it. I can see easily from these past thrity days the postive upsloap trajectory 
      my left has already taken. This is just the beginning. More programming to come.

      I will be redesigning the website from the ground up via purely my own
      HTML.
