    <h1>Learning to code</h1>
    <h2>First steps - Part 2</h2>
    <p>
      Not much has changed in that is visible on my page. I have added some styling to make the pages display differently depending
      on size of the browser window. This will enable adaptive stylings and layouts on different devices according to size. I added 
      some links to my favorite resource page. Learning by experience is the hallmark of all tutorial videos, blogs, and articles I have found.
      So I am using this page to use what I have learned and gain some experience. I am getting more familiar with HTML and CSS style sheets.
      A challenge right now is integrating my local documents seameslessly with my wordpress server. For the moment my learning of javascript is on hold
      until I finish a few more modules of HTML and CSS. In the future I will add coloring and some animations to these pages. Much has been learned about functionality,
      there is still a whole world of style and color matching to explore.
    </p>
    <h2>A list of resources</h2>
    <p>
      Some of my favorite resources are listed here. My complete list of
      resources and links are found <a href="/AllenHall/learningtocode/favoriteResources.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in learning to code than I recommend starting here.
    </p>
    <p>Soon I will add a curriculum and a call for projects</p>
    <p>
      I will be redesigning the website from the ground up via purely my own
      HTML.
